        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Asia Pacific. I am a fast learner with a broad and keen interest in discovering new innovative technologies and various forms of art.
             At this moment, I am involved in a clothing business, working as a social media manager, website manager, and graphic designer. I previously worked in an esports news portal as a content writer and graphic designer. 
             Additionally, I previously volunteered at UNYSAB as part of the graphics team.

        Academically, I have a strong interest in problem-solving,
             data structures, and algorithms. Additionally, I am eager 
             to expand my knowledge in networking and cybersecurity. 
             I am also exploring machine learning to understand its 
             potential and applications.
